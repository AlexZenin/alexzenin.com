Hi, I'm Alex! üëãüèª

I'm a full stack software engineer based in Melbourne, Australia.

My goal is to share my learnings in React, TypeScript and software development, and hopefully help others along the way.

I've been playing with [Astro](https://astro.build/) lately, and I've decided to build this blog using the [Astro Cactus](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus) theme. What appealed to me most about Astro is the ability to create components using a multitude of different frameworks, the markdown support, and integration with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I hope to not only use this blog as a platform to share information, but also as a way to explore new technologies and tools.

I'm excited that you found yourself here, and look forward to coding and building together!
